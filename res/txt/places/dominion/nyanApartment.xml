	</p>
	<p>
		You tell her how pretty she looks and she profusely blushes. Coyly shuffling her feet, she asks if you're ready to go.
	</p>
	<p>
		You reply in the affirmative, and the two of you head into the hallway, where Nyan pulls on

		</p>
		<p>
			Thanking your girlfriend for her kindness, you do as she suggests and share the umbrella with her. The two of you soon get to the Shopping Arcade.

	#ELSE

			Thankfully, the weather allows the two of you to get to the Shopping Arcade without issue.

	#ENDIF
	<p>
		Heading down the wide, marble walkways, you soon arrive at 'The Oaken Glade' and head inside. As soon as you enter, a smartly-dressed greater otter-boy, who is clearly the establishment's ma√Ætre d', steps forwards and gives Nyan a familiar smile, before greeting the two of you, [style.speechMasculine(Good evening. We have not seen you nor your mother for some time, Ms. [nyan.surname], but as ever, you are most welcome here. Please, follow me; we always have a table for you.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Following the waiter through the restaurant, you see that all of the tables are occupied, despite looking empty from the outside. Realising that this must be another aspect of the illusion to grant diners some privacy, you continue on to the other side of the forest clearing, where you and Nyan are presented with a quiet corner table for two.
	</p>
	<p>
		Taking your girlfriend's coat and umbrella, the waiter seats you both at the table and gives you each a menu, before handing you the wine menu and telling you to take your time in ordering. Slipping off to stand watch over the restaurant, the otter-boy leaves you and Nyan alone.
	</p>
	<p>
		Nyan says that she'd like to order some white wine...

	</p>
	<p>
		Doing as your girlfriend asks, you wait outside her store while she rushes back inside to fetch her coat. Your patience is soon rewarded, as just a couple of minutes later she returns wearing a stylish, tan-coloured coat, which makes her look exceptionally pretty. As she hurries back to stand before you, you see that she's also

		#ELSE
			 swapped her heels for a pair of dark brown thigh-high boots, and is also wearing a black scarf and clutching a cute, frog-styled umbrella.

		 Profusely blushing in response to the compliment you give her on her appearance, your shy girlfriend stutters, [nyan.speechNoEffects(T-Thank you, [pc.name]... C-Come on, let's go...)]

			[pc.Walking] beside your girlfriend, you exit the Shopping Arcade to see that there's an ongoing arcane storm. Letting out a little eek, Nyan huddles up to you and whines, [nyan.speechNoEffects(Oh no... My apartment is j-just five minutes from here, so p-perhaps if we hurry, it won't affect me too much...)]
		</p>
		<p>
			Doing as the cat-girl suggests, the two of you hurry down the street in the direction of her apartment. By a stroke of particularly good fortune, you manage to avoid both strikes of thunder and horny citizens during your dash towards Nyan's home. As you reach the steps of her apartment building, however, the storm above makes up for its unusual silence by unleashing one of the most powerful claps of arcane thunder you've ever heard. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Despite pulling her through the entrance and slamming the door shut behind you, you're not able to save Nyan from the arousing effects of the storm, and before you know what's happening, the cat-girl is frantically pressing her [nyan.lips+] against your mouth and lustfully grinding herself against your body. Despite knowing that her behaviour is caused by the storm, you can't help but feel aroused by this sudden, passionate display of affection, and happily return your girlfriend's kiss.
		</p>
		<p>
			Protected from any further claps of thunder, Nyan suddenly starts to come back to her senses, and with a little eek, she breaks off the kiss and stammers, [nyan.speechNoEffects(I-I'm so sorry, [pc.name]! I-I couldn't stop myself!)]
		</p>
		<p>
			Telling her that there's nothing to be sorry about, you reassuringly stroke Nyan's arm, which has the desired effect of calming her down. Making your way up the flights of stairs to the third floor, the two of you soon arrive at the door to your girlfriend's apartment, where she turns to face you and nervously shuffles her feet, before looking at you with her big, blue eyes and saying, [nyan.speechNoEffects(Y-You can come in if you'd like...)]
