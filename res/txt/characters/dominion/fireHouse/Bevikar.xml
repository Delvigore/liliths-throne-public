		As you walk down one of Dominion's wide, marble-paved boulevards, you find yourself passing by Mommy's house again. Glancing over towards it, you see the [npc.race] sitting on her usual wooden bench. Almost instantly, she looks up and catches your eye, before beckoning you over.

		Walking up to the rental mommy, you smile at her as she uncrosses her legs and pats her thick thighs. [npc.speech(Heya sweetie! Do you want Mommy to give you a nice lap pillow? As the shirt says, it's only fifty flames!)]

		You wonder if you should take Mommy up on her offer, or decline and continue on your way...

		You make a brief, non-committal response, before quickly moving off and continuing on your way.
