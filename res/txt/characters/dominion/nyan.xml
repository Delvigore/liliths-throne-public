Despite profusely blushing at this overt display of affection, Nyan squeezes her slender, padded fingers around your [pc.hand] and moves closer so as to walk right beside you. Looking over at her, you see her cat-like ears twitching in excitement, and as her fluffy tail curls up behind her, she quietly mutters, [nyan.speechNoEffects(I-I really like this...)]

	<p>
		Smiling at her confession, you continue holding Nyan's delicate, feminine hand all the way back to where your walk began. Not letting go, your girlfriend then allows you to lead the way as you cross the shop's busy floor, and only once the two of you are back in the quiet of the storeroom does she release her grip.

	</p>
	<p>
		Despite her words, Nyan happily leans into you, before gently tilting her head to one side and slightly parting her [nyan.lips+]. With her hot breath falling on your face, and the faint scent of her perfume in the air, you lean forwards and press your [pc.lips] against hers. Almost instantly, you feel Nyan's arms wrap around your back, and she starts letting out little muffled moans as you slide your [pc.tongue+] into her mouth.
	</p>
	<p>
		Although she'd initially expressed alarm at kissing in public, your girlfriend quickly loses herself in the moment, and continues to passionately return your kiss for quite some time. Eventually, however, she pulls back to breathe, at which point she suddenly seems to recall where she is, and with her cheeks flushing bright red, she buries her face in your shoulder and exclaims, [nyan.speechNoEffects(L-Let's go back now!)]

		Smiling at her sudden turn of shyness, you allow Nyan to hold onto you and hide her face in your chest as you somewhat-awkwardly [pc.walk] all the way back to her store.

	</p>
	<p>
		Having by now travelled around most of the Arcade, the two of you soon find yourselves approaching the corner near to where Nyan's store is located. At this moment, your girlfriend suddenly lets out an excited gasp and exclaims, [nyan.speechNoEffects(That's my favourite restaurant! L-Look, [pc.name]!)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Following Nyan over to stand in front of this restaurant, you see that the name 'The Oaken Glade' is proudly written in flowing gold lettering above its front door. The establishment's large windows allow the two of you to look in on an incredible scene; the vast interior has been manipulated by some form of arcane-powered illusion, making it appear as though the restaurant is a portal directly into the middle of a summer-time forest clearing.

Turning to face you, she gives you another of her cute smiles, and while gazing longingly at you with her big, blue eyes, she reveals, [nyan.speechNoEffects(That was the m-most fun I've had in a long time.

		Although it was no more than a short walk, your time together seems to have had a significant impact on the typically-nervous cat-girl's demeanour, and as you respond to her thanks, she suddenly does something very uncharacteristic of her. Still gazing into your [pc.eyes], your girlfriend steps forwards, and with her [nyan.breastSize], [nyan.cupSize]-cup breasts rising and falling as she pants with excitement, she leans forwards and allows her [nyan.lips+] to part a little.

At that moment, you suddenly feel your girlfriend's furry tail excitedly curling around your [pc.leg(true)], while her cat-like ears twitch in anticipation of what's about to happen.
	</p>
	<p>
		With the delicate scent of her perfume drawing you in, you lean forwards and give Nyan what she wants. Pressing your [pc.lips] against hers, you pull the cat-girl into a deep, passionate kiss. Lifting her arms and wrapping them around your back, your girlfriend starts letting out little muffled moans as you lustfully slide your tongues into one another's mouths.

		Knowing that the influence of her romance novels has given Nyan some well-defined ideas about how a relationship should progress, you don't try to push her past her comfort zone, and instead let go of her hips and allow her to take a step back. Lifting her tail and happily stroking it, the cute cat-girl happily smiles at you and asks, [nyan.speechNoEffects(We'll do this again, right? T-That was so much better than my books made it out to be...)]

		Giving her arm a reassuring stroke, you tell Nyan that you enjoyed your kiss just as much as she did. Knowing that she has a limit on how much excitement she can deal with in one day, you give your girlfriend a loving smile and wonder what to do next...
